Component Life Cycle

1. componentDidMount(): Called once component mounted (was evaluated & rendered).
Equivalent to useEffect hook in functional components. useEffect(..., [])

2. componentDidUpdate(): Called once component was updated (was evaluated & rendered)
Equivalent to useEffect hook with some dependencies. useEffect(..., [dependencies])

3. componentWillUnmount(): Called right before the component is unmounted(removed from the DOM)
Equivalent is the cleanup function in the useEffect hook.
useEffect( ()=> {
    
    //Cleanup function
    return ()=> {...}
}, [])

4. componentsDidCatch(): It can be added to any class component to make it an error boundary.
It would be triggered whenever a child component throws or triggers an error.
